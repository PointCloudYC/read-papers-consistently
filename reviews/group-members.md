"An Application Oriented Scan-to-BIM Framework", Remote Sensing, January 2019.

- gap; no frameworks which systematically study on the key steps and consideration of this Scan-to-BIM process.

- proposal; propose an application-oriented framework for scan-to-BIM, which describes the four major steps of a scan-to-BIM process and their relationships.

- core components of the proposal; data acquisition and then reconstruction.

- how to accomplish that? check the below figures. For more comments, check my Zotero PDFs w. comments for this paper.

- how can you use this paper?
  - Understand BIM from different phrases including design, construction and O&M.
  - The proposal which enlightens me to think the process from several other perspectives like software engineering, fulfill the task according to requirements.
  - Data quality can be measured by four parameters: range error, spatial resolution, coverage, and other property error (reflectivity, rgb color)
  - typical scenarios for the scan-to-BIM process; the 2 key tasks are object recognition and geometry extraction.
  - **Interested and potential directions are**: use DL to tackle the object recognition issue; moreover, use simulators such as CARLA, UE4 to generate synthetic LiDAR-like data or even leverage generative deep learning techniques such as Variational auto-encoders(VAEs) or generative adversarial networks(GANs) to generate the LiDAR-like data.

- imp refs; added to my paper list.
