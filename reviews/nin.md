# Review of network in network
[Network In Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4400)

## notes/comments
### bg
point conv/ 1x1 conv
- add non-linearity to the net
- channel-wise conv(allow shrink on channels, note pooling layers allow to shink on space(width and height))
- is used in inception network

### proposal

### key components and achitecture

### how it can be used
